                <ul class="game_rules">
                    <li>Take a shot before the game.</li>
                    <li>Take a shot for every goal your team scores. (This counts if the enemy scores on themselves, but does not count if your team scores on themselves.)</li>
                    <li>Take two shots for losing.</li>
                    <li>Take the number of shots difference if you lost without scoring a single goal. For example if you lose 0-4, your team would take 4 shots to catch up.</li>
                    <li>If you get Brazil'd (7-1) then your team must take 7 shots as punishment.</li>
                </ul>
